This project is divided into three parts, 
PrimeGeneration: generating large prime numbers to support both the encryption and decryption.
RSA_CiphertoMes: decrypting the cipher to the message we trasfer.
RSA_MestoCipher: encrypting the message to the cipher.

In our design, we set each of three parts as a individual runnable project rather than assemble them into a large project.
